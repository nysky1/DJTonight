<h1>What's Hot Tonight</h1>

"What's Hot Tonight" is designed to direct users to the hottest music shows of the night in their local city.  There's no shortage of bands playing on a given night, but it takes some time to determine if those bands are popular or just getting started.  The app displays the TOP 5 hottest events in the specified area (works best in the U.S. but does some have some coverage outside the United States).

A Spotify login is recommended so that when you choose an event, we can show a Spotify embedded music player allowing you to preview the selected HOT band.
